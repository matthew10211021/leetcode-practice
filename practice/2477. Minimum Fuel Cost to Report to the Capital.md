## 2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital
### Algorithm
- Run a DFS so that each call return the number of passengers at that node to the parent
- At a particular node, number of cars taken to reach the parent will be `ceil(number of passengers at that node / seats)`
- Keep track of a global variable to keep track of the accumulated fuel required
- Notice that in the `dfs` function, we need to keep track of a `parent` parameter to prevent cyclic traversal
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def minimumFuelCost(self, roads, seats):
    # build adjacency list
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    result = [0]

    def dfs(node, parent):
        passengers = 0

        # traverse all the neighbour (EXCLUDING THE PARENT)
        for child in adj[node]:
            if child != parent:
                p = dfs(child, node)
                passengers += p

                # update result
                result[0] += int(ceil(p / seats))  # fuel for passenger to reach the node

        return passengers + 1

    dfs(0, -1)
        
    return result[0]
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
long long dfs(unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& adj, long long& result, int& seats, int node, int parent) {
    int passengers = 0;

    // traverse every child EXCLUDING PARENT (to prevent cyclic traversal)
    int child, p;
    for (int i = 0; i < adj[node].size(); ++i) {
        child = adj[node][i];
        if (child != parent) {
            p = dfs(adj, result, seats, child, node);
            passengers += p;
            result += ceil((double)p / seats);
        }
    }

    return passengers + 1;
}

long long minimumFuelCost(vector<vector<int>>& roads, int seats) {
    long long result = 0;

    // build adjacency list
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adj;
    for (int i = 0; i < roads.size(); ++i) {
        adj[roads[i][0]].push_back(roads[i][1]);
        adj[roads[i][1]].push_back(roads[i][0]);
    }

    // call helper to update result
    dfs(adj, result, seats, 0, -1);

    return result;
}
```
