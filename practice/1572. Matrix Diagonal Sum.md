## 1572. Matrix Diagonal Sum
### Algorithm
- In case of odd size, we will have an overlapped region
- In case of even size, we will not have overlapping
- To do a little optimization, we aim at doing on pass, which can be achieved by row iteration
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def diagonalSum(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(mat)
    result = 0

    for r in range(n):
        result += mat[r][r]  # for main diag
        result += mat[r][n-r-1]  # for secondary diag

    return result if (n % 2 == 0) else (result - mat[n//2][n//2])
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int diagonalSum(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
    int n = mat.size();
    int result = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < mat.size(); ++r) {
        result += mat[r][r];
        result += mat[r][n-r-1];
    }

    return (n % 2 == 0) ? result : (result - mat[n/2][n/2]);
}
```
