## 2421. Number of Good Paths
### Algorithm
- If we consider nodes from largest to smallest, then the condition that "all intermediate nodes are smaller than the start" will be automatically satisfied
- Idea: after the current largest value is processed, we eliminate all the nodes with current largest value and corresponding edges
- Sort the edges based on `max(vals[u], vals[v])`
- Gradually add the edges to build up the graph from the above sorted order
- Every time we add an edge, we are actually performing a *union* operation, so we need a union find data structure
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```Python
def numberOfGoodPaths(self, vals: List[int], edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(vals)
    p = list(range(n))
    count = [Counter({vals[i]:1}) for i in range(n)]
    edges = sorted((max(vals[i],vals[j]),i,j) for i,j in edges)
    res = n
    def find(i):
        if p[i] != i:
            p[i] = find(p[i])
        return p[i]
    for val, i, j in edges:
        pi, pj = find(i), find(j)
        res += count[pi][val]*count[pj][val]
        p[pi] = pj
        count[pj][val] += count[pi][val]
    return res
```
