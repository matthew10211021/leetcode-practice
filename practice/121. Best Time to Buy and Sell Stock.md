## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
### Algorithm
- Keep track of the minimum price that we have seen so far
- For each price, potentially update the profit by minusing the minimum price that we have seen so far
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complextiy: O(1)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]):
    profit = 0
    min_price = 10 ** 4 + 1  # just higher than the potential highest price
    
    for price in prices:
        # potentiall update the min price
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        
        # potentially update the profit (if the current profit is larger than the profit)
        profit = max(profit, price - min_price)
        
    return profit
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int profit = 0;
    int min_price = pow(10, 4) + 1;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
        // potentially update the min price
        if (prices[i] < min_price) min_price = prices[i];
        
        // potentially update the profit
        profit = prices[i] - min_price > profit ? prices[i] - min_price : profit;
    }
    
    return profit;
}
```
