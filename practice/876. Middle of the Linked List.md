## 876. Middle of the Linked List
### Algorithm
- Simple 2 pointers (slow, fast) technique
- `slow` and `fast` pointers initially start at `head`
- Each time increment `slow` by one jump and `fast` by two jump
- Repeat the above process until `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null
- Return `slow` afterwards
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def middleNode(self, head):
    slow, fast = head, head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    return slow
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;

    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    return slow;
}
```
