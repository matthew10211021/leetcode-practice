## 319. Bulb Switcher
### Algorithm
- At round i, bulbs with factor `i` will be toggled once
- We want to find the number of bulbs that have odd number of factor
- It turns out that perfect square number has an odd number of factors, since any number's factors come in pairs, but the **square root of perfect square number paired with itself** :)
- Thus, the answer is `floor(sqrt(n))`
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def bulbSwitch(self, n: int) -> int:
    return int(sqrt(n))
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int bulbSwitch(int n) {
    return (int) sqrt(n);
}
```
