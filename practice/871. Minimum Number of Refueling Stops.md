## 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops
### Method 1: Heap
### Algorithm
- go to the right in a greedy manner, i.e., we go as right as possible
- keep track of the intermediate stations that we have passed through (but we didn't take), store the staitons in a max heap
- in case we run out of gas but cannot reach the end, we can iterate through our heap and search for refuels
- Time complexity: O(n log n)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def minRefuelStops(self, target, startFuel, stations):
    heap = []
    tank = startFuel

    stations.append([target, float('inf')])  # pretend that the target is actually the station

    refuels = 0
    prev = 0

    for position, fuel in stations:
        # go to that location
        tank -= (position - prev)
        # we should have refueled some where
        while heap and tank < 0:
            tank += -heapq.heappop(heap)
            refuels += 1
        if tank < 0:
            return -1
        # add our the fuel in our current station
        heapq.heappush(heap, -fuel)
        prev = position  # update the prev position

    return refuels
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>>& stations) {
    vector<int> heap;
    int tank = startFuel;

    stations.push_back(vector<int>({target, INT_MAX}));

    int refuels = 0;
    int prev = 0;
    int position, fuel;
    for (int i = 0; i < stations.size(); ++i) {
        position = stations[i][0]; fuel = stations[i][1];
        tank -= (position - prev);
        while (!heap.empty() && tank < 0) {
            tank += heap.front();
            pop_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
            heap.pop_back();
            ++refuels;
        }
        if (tank < 0) return -1;
        heap.push_back(fuel);
        push_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
        prev = position;
    }
    return refuels;
}
```
### Method 2: DP
### Algorithm
- define dp[i] to be the fartest location that we can reach by using i stations in total
- base case: dp[0] = `startFuel`, since the maximum distance we can reach with zero station is the initial fuel given
- recursive case: if we are at station[j], where position_j <= dp[i], then we can potentially update dp[i+1] using the formula dp[i+1] = max(dp[i+1], dp[i] + fuel[j])
- lastly, iterate through the dp array from small index to large index to get our result
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def minRefuelStops(self, target, startFuel, stations):
    dp = [0] * (len(stations) + 1)
    dp[0] = startFuel  # base case

    for i, (position, fuel) in enumerate(stations):
        for j in range(i, -1, -1):
            if dp[j] >= position:
                dp[j+1] = max(dp[j+1], dp[j] + fuel)

    # iterate from small index to large index in dp
    for i in range(len(dp)):
        if dp[i] >= target:
            return i
    return -1
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>>& stations) {
    vector<long> dp(stations.size() + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = startFuel;  // base case

    int position, fuel;
    for (int i = 0; i < stations.size(); ++i) {
        position = stations[i][0]; fuel = stations[i][1];
        for (int j = i; j >= 0; --j) {
            if (dp[j] >= position) dp[j+1] = std::max(dp[j+1], dp[j] + fuel);
        }
    }

    // iterate from small index to large index in dp
    for (int i = 0; i < dp.size(); ++i) {
        if (dp[i] >= target) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
