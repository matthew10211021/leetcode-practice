## 946. Validate Stack Sequences
### Algorithm
- Simply run a simulation
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space compelxity: O(n)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
    my_stack = []
    i = 0  # pointer to the popped array

    for num in pushed:
        my_stack.append(num)
        # pop as much as possible
        while my_stack and popped[i] == my_stack[-1]:
            my_stack.pop()
            i += 1

    return not my_stack
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
    vector<int> my_stack;
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < pushed.size(); ++j) {
        my_stack.push_back(pushed[j]);
        while (!my_stack.empty() && my_stack[my_stack.size() - 1] == popped[i]) {
            my_stack.pop_back();
            ++i;
        }
    }

    return my_stack.empty();
}
```
