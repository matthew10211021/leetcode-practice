## 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
### Algorithm
- Observation: there is a lower bound and upper bound on the potential answers
- For particular `capacity` value, we can use a function `possible` to check whether we can ship within n days with the given `capacity`
- The `possible` function is trivial, and will take O(n) time
- After that, we can search on the possible answer space:
    - lower bound will be `max(weights)`
    - upper bound will be `sum(weights)`
- Since we are given a restriction on `weights[i]` and `weights.length`, the complexity of the binary search O(`sum(weights)`-`max(weights)`) is in fact very small
- Time complexity: n * O(`sum(weights)`-`max(weights)`)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def shipWithinDays(self, weights, days):
    # helper function
    def possible(capacity):
        rolling_cap = 0
        rolling_days = 1
        for weight in weights:
            # check if the current aggregate plus weight exceed capacity
            if rolling_cap + weight > capacity:
                rolling_days += 1
                rolling_cap = weight
            else:
                rolling_cap += weight

            if rolling_days > days: return False

        return True

    result = float('inf')

    # binary search on the answer
    # the upper bound will be the sum of weights
    l, r = max(weights), sum(weights)
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if possible(mid):
            result = min(mid, result)
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1

    return result
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
bool possible(int capacity, vector<int>& weights, int& days) {
    int rolling_cap = 0, rolling_days = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < weights.size(); ++i) {
        if (rolling_cap + weights[i] > capacity) {
            ++rolling_days;
            rolling_cap = weights[i];
        }
        else rolling_cap += weights[i];

        if (rolling_days > days) return false;
    }

    return true;
}

int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
    int l = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
    int r = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
    int result = INT_MAX;
    int mid;
    while (l <= r) {
        mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
        if (possible(mid, weights, days)) {
            result = min(result, mid);
            r = mid - 1;
        }
        else l = mid + 1;
    }

    return result;
}
```
