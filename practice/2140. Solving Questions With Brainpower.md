## 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower
### Algorithm
- Define `dp[i]` to be the maximum points obtained by starting the exam at index `i`
- At each index, we have a decision to make:
    - Take the question, and then go to the next solvable question
    - Do not take the question, take the next question (adjacent)
    - Take the maximum of the two !
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(questions)
    dp = [0] * n

    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        take = questions[i][0] + (dp[i + 1 + questions[i][1]] if i + 1 + questions[i][1] < n else 0)
        not_take = (dp[i+1] if i + 1 < n else 0)
        dp[i] = max(take, not_take)

    return dp[0]
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
    int n = questions.size();
    vector<long long> dp(n);

    long long take, not_take;
    for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i) {
        take = questions[i][0] + ((i+1+questions[i][1] < n) ? dp[i+1+questions[i][1]] : 0);
        not_take = ((i+1 < n) ? dp[i+1] : 0);
        dp[i] = max(take, not_take);
    }

    return dp[0];
}
```
