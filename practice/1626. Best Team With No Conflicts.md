## 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts
### Algorithm
- Similar to the problem of "longest increasing subsequence" with an extra condition
- Pre-processing: sort by age
- Then, define `dp[i]` to be the maximum total score that we can achieve by **having sorted score[i] as the maximum value**
- We must choose values on the left then for `dp[i]` (since we need younger one)
- Solve the problem by the same approach as "longest increasing subsequence" problem
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def bestTeamScore(self, scores, ages):
    n = len(scores)

    # create the list of (age, score) pair
    pairs = [(age, score) for age, score in zip(ages, scores)]
    
    # sort by age, then by score (to break ties)
    pairs.sort()

    # define dp[i] to be the largest score achieved by considering up to i and INCLUDE i
    dp = [score for _, score in pairs]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            # potentially update dp[i]
            if pairs[j][1] <= pairs[i][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], pairs[i][1] + dp[j])

    return max(dp)
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int bestTeamScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& ages) {
    int n = scores.size();
    vector<vector<int>> pairs;  // (age, score)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) pairs.push_back(vector<int>({ages[i], scores[i]}));
    sort(pairs.begin(), pairs.end());

    vector<int> dp(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) dp[i] = pairs[i][1];

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (pairs[j][1] <= pairs[i][1]) dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], pairs[i][1] + dp[j]);
        }
    }

    return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}
```
