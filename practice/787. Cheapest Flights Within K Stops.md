## 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
### Algorithm
- This problem is a shortest path problem with restriction that **at most k + 1 edges can be taken**
- Thus, the **Bellman Ford's Algorithm** can help solve the problem
- **Relax** all the edges for k + 1 times
- Return the shortest distance if the path from `src` to `dst` is relaxed at least 1 time (i.e., not equal to the default value), otherwise return -1
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def findCheapestPrice(self, n, flights, src, dst, k):
    # run Bellman Ford's Algorithm for k + 1 iterations
    paths = {i: 10 ** 5 for i in range(n)}
    paths[src] = 0  # base condition: distance to src to itself is 0

    for _ in range(k + 1):
        temp = paths.copy()  # temp is updated, paths still keep track of current snapshot
        # iterate all edges
        for u, v, price in flights:
            # relax
            if paths[u] + price < temp[v]:
                temp[v] = paths[u] + price  # update temp
        paths = temp  # after processing all, copy temp to paths

    return paths[dst] if paths[dst] != 10 ** 5 else -1
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
    // initialize the dist map
    map<int, int> paths;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) paths[i] = pow(10, 5);
    paths[src] = 0;  // base condition: distance to src from itself is 0

    // run Bellman Ford for k + 1 times
    map<int, int> temp;
    int u, v, price;
    for (int i = 0; i < k + 1; ++i) {
        temp = paths;
        for (int j = 0; j < flights.size(); ++j) {
            u = flights[j][0]; v = flights[j][1]; price = flights[j][2];
            // relax
            if (paths[u] + price < temp[v]) temp[v] = paths[u] + price;
        }
        paths = temp;
    }

    return (paths[dst] == pow(10, 5)) ? -1 : paths[dst];
}
