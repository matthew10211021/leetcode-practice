## 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
### Algorithm
- Simply observe the pattern of 4 possible cases:
    - `low` is odd, `high` is odd
    - `low `is odd, `high` is even
    - `low` is even, `high` is odd
    - `low` is even, `high` is even
- Generalize the pattern into formulas:
    - `low` is odd, `high` is odd: `(high - low) // 2 + 1`
    - `low `is odd, `high` is even: `(high - low) // 2 + 1`
    - `low` is even, `high` is odd: `(high - low) // 2 + 1`
    - `low` is even, `high` is even: `(high - low) // 2`
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def countOdds(self, low, high):
    if low % 2 == 0 and high % 2 == 0:
        return (high - low) // 2
    else:
        return (high - low) // 2 + 1
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int countOdds(int low, int high) {
    if (low % 2 == 0 && high % 2 == 0) return (high - low) / 2;
    else return (high - low) / 2 + 1;
}
```
