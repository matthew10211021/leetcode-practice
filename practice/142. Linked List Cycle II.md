## 142. Linked List Cycle II
### Method 1: Hash set
### Algorithm
- Use a hash set to keep track of all the visited nodes
- Once we visit a node that has already been visited before, then we will return it
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n), due to the use of hash set
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
    nodes = set()

    cur = head

    while cur:
        if cur in nodes: return cur

        # push the node to map
        nodes.add(cur)
        cur = cur.next

    return None
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
    set<ListNode*> nodes;
    ListNode* cur = head;

    while (cur) {
        if (nodes.find(cur) != nodes.end()) return cur;

        // add the current node to the set
        nodes.insert(cur);
        cur = cur->next;
    }

    return nullptr;
}
```
## Method 2: Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm (probably impossible to figure it out, just recite it)
### Algorithm
- The algortihm has two phases
- Phase 1: slow pointer and fast pointer, stop until they meet each other
- Phase 2: two slow pointers (`p1` is the previous slow pointer, `p2` starts from the head), stop until they meet each other
- Return the position of meet in phase 2
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
    # phase 1: fast and slow
    slow, fast = head, head

    while fast and fast.next:
        # update the slow and fast pointers
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        # phase 1 passed -> phase 2: two slow pointers
        if slow == fast:
            p1, p2 = head, slow
            while p1 != p2:
                p1 = p1.next
                p2 = p2.next
            return p1
            
    # break out of the loop -> no cycle
    return None
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
    ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;

    while (fast && fast->next) {
        // update the slow and fast pointers
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;

        // phase 1 passed -> phase 2: two slow pointers
        if (slow == fast) {
            ListNode *p1 = slow, *p2 = head;
            while (p1 != p2) {
                p1 = p1->next;
                p2 = p2->next;
            }
            return p1;
        }
    }

    return nullptr;
}
```
