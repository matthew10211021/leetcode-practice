## 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c
### Algorithm
- Check the bit (from right to left) one by one
- In case bit from `c` is 1, then flip **one** bit in case both bits from `a` and `b` are zero
- In case bit from `c` is 0, then flip bit from `a` and/or `b` in case the bit is 1 (may flip zero, one or two bits)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    answer = 0
    while a or  b or c:
        if c & 1 == 1:
            answer += 0 if (a & 1 == 1 or b & 1 == 1) else 1
        else:  # c & 1 == 0
            answer += (a & 1) + (b & 1)

        a >>= 1
        b >>= 1
        c >>= 1

    return answer
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    int answer = 0;
    while (a != 0 || b != 0 || c != 0) {
        if ((c & 1) == 1) answer += (((a & 1) == 1 || (b & 1) == 1) ? 0 : 1);
        else answer += (a & 1) + (b & 1);
        a >>= 1;
        b >>= 1;
        c >>= 1;
    }

    return answer;
}
```
