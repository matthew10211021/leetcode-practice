## 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets
### Algorithm
- Define dp[i] be the minimum cost for tickets up to day i
- For day i, in case we need traval, there are three choices:
    - buy a 1-day pass, then cost costs[0] + dp[i-1]
    - buy a 7-day pass, then cost costs[1] + dp[i-7]
    - buy a 30-dya pass, then cost costs[2] + dp[i-30]
- We will take the minimum of the above 3
- In case we need not travel in day i, then simply use dp[i-1], since we do not need a ticket
- Time complexity: O(max(days))
- Space complexity: O(max(days)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], c: List[int]):
        s = set(days)
        dp = [0] * (days[-1] + 1)

        for day in range(1, days[-1] + 1):
            if day not in s: dp[day] = dp[day - 1]
            else: dp[day] = min(c[0] + dp[max(0, day-1)], 
                                c[1] + dp[max(0, day-7)], 
                                c[2] + dp[max(0, day-30)])

        return dp[days[-1]]
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& c) {
    int last_day = days[days.size() - 1];
    vector<int> dp(last_day+1, 0);
    unordered_set<int> s(days.begin(), days.end());

    for (int day = 1; day <= last_day; ++day) {
        if (s.find(day) == s.end()) dp[day] = dp[day-1];
        else {
            dp[day] = min(c[0] + dp[max(0, day-1)], min(c[1] + dp[max(0, day-7)], c[2] + dp[max(0, day-30)]));
        }
    }

    return dp[last_day];
}
```
