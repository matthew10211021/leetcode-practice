## 904. Fruit Into Baskets
### Algorithm
- Use a sliding window approach together with a hash map
- Expand the window at a time, update the corresponding count in the hash map and the current number of fruit `cur`
- In case the number of keys in the hash map exceeds 2 (i.e., we are having more than 2 distinct fruits), we need to shrink the window from the left until we have two fruits remaining, update the corresponding count in the hash map and `cur`
- Potentially update the `result` after the above procedure
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def totalFruit(self, fruits):
    l = 0
    cur = 0
    result = 0
    count = defaultdict(int)  # (key, val) = (type of fruit, frequency)

    for r in range(len(fruits)):
        # add element to the right
        count[fruits[r]] += 1
        cur += 1
        
        # check if the number of unique fruits exceeds 2
        # if so, continuously popping from the left
        while len(count) > 2:
            fruit = fruits[l]
            count[fruit] -= 1
            cur -= 1
            l += 1
            # in case the count drops down to zero, then remove the element from the map
            if count[fruit] == 0:
                count.pop(fruit)

        # potentially update the result
        result = max(cur, result)

    return result
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
    int result = 0, cur = 0, l = 0;
    unordered_map<int, int> count;

    int fruit;
    for (int r = 0; r < fruits.size(); ++r) {
        // add an element to the right
        ++count[fruits[r]];
        ++cur;

        // check if the number of fruits exceeds 2
        while (count.size() > 2) {
            fruit = fruits[l];
            --count[fruit];
            --cur;
            ++l;
            if (count[fruit] == 0) count.erase(fruit);
        }

        // potentially update the result
        result = std::max(result, cur);
    }

    return result;
}
```
