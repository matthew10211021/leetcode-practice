## 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
### Algorithm
- Intuition: we want to join events with earlier ending time, so that we can **leave more rooms for the remaining meetings**
- Sort the events based on the starting timestamp
- Based on the sorted order, iterate through all the possible start time
- For each possible start time, choose the one with smallest end time and take it, increment the current time by 1
- We can use a min heap to keep track of all the end times
- In case the end time already exceed the current time, discard the element
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def maxEvents(self, events):
    events.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    total_days = max([event[1] for event in events])
    min_heap = []
    day, count, event_id = 1, 0, 0
    while day <= total_days:
        # no events available, let time flies to next available event
        if event_id < len(events) and not min_heap:
            day = events[event_id][0]

        # add all events starting from today (newly available) to min heap
        while event_id < len(events) and events[event_id][0] == day:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, events[event_id][1])
            event_id += 1

        # discard all events already ended
        while min_heap and min_heap[0] < day:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # attend the event that will end the earliest
        if min_heap:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            count += 1

        # check break condition
        elif event_id >= len(events):
            break
        
        day += 1

    return count
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
    sort(events.begin(), events.end());
    int total_days = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < events.size(); ++i) total_days = max(total_days, events[i][1]);
    vector<int> min_heap;
    make_heap(min_heap.begin(), min_heap.end());
    int day = 1, count = 0, event_id = 0;

    while (day <= total_days) {
        // no events available, let time flies to the next available event
        if (event_id < events.size() && min_heap.size() == 0) day = events[event_id][0];

        // add all events starting from today in min heap
        while (event_id < events.size() && events[event_id][0] == day) {
            min_heap.push_back(-events[event_id][1]);  // push negated (since C++ gives a default max heap)
            push_heap(min_heap.begin(), min_heap.end());
            ++event_id;
        }

        // discard all events already ended
        while (min_heap.size() != 0 && -min_heap.front() < day) {
            pop_heap(min_heap.begin(), min_heap.end());
            min_heap.pop_back();
        }

        // attend the event that will end the earliest
        if (min_heap.size() != 0) {
            pop_heap(min_heap.begin(), min_heap.end());
            min_heap.pop_back();
            ++count;
        }
        else if (event_id >= events.size()) break;

        ++day;
    }

    return count;
}
```
