## 881. Boats to Save People
### Algorithm
- Assign boats in a greedy manner: the heaviest one pair up with the lightest one
- Sort the weight and use two pointers to perform the task
- Time complexity: O(n log n), dominated by sorting
- Space complexity: O(1)
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
    # sort the people's weight in increasing order
    people.sort()

    # two pointers
    l, r = 0, len(people) - 1
    boats = 0

    while l < r:
        boats += 1

        # take the heaviest
        remainder = limit - people[r]
        r -= 1

        # check if we can take the lightest
        if remainder >= people[l]: l += 1

    return boats if l > r else boats + 1
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
    // sort vector
    sort(people.begin(), people.end());

    // run two pointers algorithm
    int l = 0, r = people.size() - 1;
    int boats = 0;

    while (l < r) {
        // create a new boat
        ++boats;

        int remainder = limit - people[r];
        --r;

        // check if we can carry an extra passanger (lightest weight)
        if (remainder >= people[l]) ++l;
    }

    return (l > r) ? boats : (boats + 1);
}
```
