## 2306. Naming a Company
### Algorithm
- Brute force solution: look through every pair of words, which take O(n^2 * w) time
- Observation 1: 
    - in case that first letter of 2 words are equal, they cannot do anything for us
- Observation 2:
    - in case that the suffix (excluding the first character) are equal, they cannot do anything for us
- Create a hashmap (using the first character as key) of hashsets
- Iterate the group pairs in the hashmap (there are at most 26 groups in the map !), which will take O(26^2) = O(1) time ! (taken into account the observation 1)
- For each group, the **distinct, non overlapping word** can be used !!!
- To perform the above counting, we can iterate one set and count the overlapping region
- subtract the count of overlapping region from the length of each of the set, and the compute the product times 2, add to the result
### Implementation
Python Solution:
```python
def distinctNames(self, idea):
    # first char -> word suffix
    wordMap = defaultdict(set)
    for w in ideas:
        wordMap[ord(w[0]) - ord('a')].add(w[1:])

    result = 0

    # iterate the different 
    for i in range(26):
        for j in range(i+1, 26):
            intersect = 0  # count the number of duplicate
            # choose any one set to iterate
            for w in wordMap[i]:
                if w in wordMap[j]:
                    intersect += 1

            # compute the product
            result += 2 * (len(wordMap[i]) - intersect) * (len(wordMap[j]) - intersect)

    return result
```
C++ Solution:
```cpp
long long distinctNames(vector<string>& ideas) {
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<string>> wordMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < ideas.size(); ++i) wordMap[ideas[i][0] - 'a'].insert(ideas[i].substr(1, ideas[i].length() - 1));

    long long result = 0;
    int intersection;
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < 26; ++j) {
            intersection = 0;  // count the intersection
            // iterate through any of the group
            for (auto it = wordMap[i].begin(); it != wordMap[i].end(); ++it) {
                if (wordMap[j].find(*it) != wordMap[j].end()) ++intersection;
            }

            result += 2 * (wordMap[i].size() - intersection) * (wordMap[j].size() - intersection);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```
